These are notes from D. Richard Hipp; but, I couldn't
get this exact sample to work.  Instead, see example4.y

There's a bug in lemon such that it doesn't like the primary
non-terminal to be recursive.  So do this:

 main ::= in.

Then in addition to what you have it should work.

Correction:  There *used* to be this bug in lemon.  I think
it is now fixed.  The problem above is that there is no
initial case for the in term.  You need this:

    in ::= .
    in ::= in stmt ENDLINE.

Gpending a bunch of time writing some YACC grammars using
Flex and Bison. Flex and Bison are GNU ports of Lex and Yacc
respectively. These tools were originally designed to generate C
code. However, I wanted to be able to use Bison to generate C++
code. Writing context-free grammars is easy; getting C and C++ code
to interop seamlessly is not ;( Man, did I feel lots of pain. The
purpose of this entry is to hopefully prevent other folks from
feeling the same pain that I felt today.

The generally accepted practice is to let Flex generate C code,
and to trick Bison into generating C++ code.[1] This means,
however, that you now are mixing C and C++ code within the same
application. To fix the inevitable compiler errors that will result
from this unholy combination, you'll need to tell your C++ compiler
to turn off name mangling for certain symbols. This, of course,
requires that you understand how Flex and Bison talk to each other.

Bison calls the Flex-generated yylex() function to obtain the next
token from Flex. Since yylex() will be compiled in a "C" source
file, you need to disable name mangling of this function. This is
conveniently done using the extern "C" directive and declaring the
yylex() function prototype in the header of your Bison file:

extern "C" {
  int yylex( void );
}

In C++ code, you can only define a method once. The yyerror() method
is called by Bison-generated code to report errors. Therefore, you
must add a forward-reference to your yyerror() implementation that
you'll write at the bottom of your Bison source code file by adding:

int yyerror( const char * );

to your Bison file's header.

To complicate matters, I wasn't reading input from stdin and stdout;
I was reading input from strings that are passed to my parser. This
required me to call the yy_scan_string() and yy_delete_buffer()
methods from my C++ code. Therefore, I needed to turn off name
mangling for these symbols as well. Here's all of the code that
you'll need to add to your Bison file's header to turn off name
mangling.

typedef struct yy_buffer_state *YY_BUFFER_STATE;

extern "C" {
  int             yylex( void ); YY_BUFFER_STATE yy_scan_string(
  const char * ); void            yy_delete_buffer( YY_BUFFER_STATE
  );
}

But wait, there's more pain! In my Bison file, I need to use unions,
since I would pass both token values and text values back to my
Bison grammar. Here's the union definition from my Bison file:

%union {
  int    token; char  *string;
}

This union is manifested through a global variable called
yylval. Once Bison is finished generating code, you'll wind up with
a declaration that looks like:

typedef union {
  int token; char *string;
} YYSTYPE;

YYSTYPE yylval;

However, yylval is defined by Bison, not Flex. And the
Bison-generated file is a C++ file, whereas the Flex-generated
code is a C file. This means that you need to disable name mangling
of yylval.

When Bison generates code, it does so by using a template file
called bison.simple. Unfortunately, the version of bison.simple
that I got from Wilbur Streett's otherwise excellent Win32 port of
Flex and Bison did not disable name mangling of yylval. Therefore,
I needed to replace 117 of his file:

YYSTYPE yylval;

with some conditionally compiled code:

#ifdef __cplusplus
  extern "C" YYSTYPE yylval;
#else
  YYSTYPE yylval;
#endif

With these fixes in place, I'm happy to report that I can finally
use Bison to generate C++ code, and Flex to generate C code. More
importantly, figuring out how to get the generated C++ and C code
to talk to each other greatly deepened my understanding of how Flex
and Bison work together to generate your parser.

[1] This is an excellent tutorial for Lex and Yacc. In particular,
Section 5 is invaluable in telling you why you need to leave Lex
as it is and to NOT use the -+ option.
