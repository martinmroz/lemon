/*
 ** A generic merge-sort program.
 **
 ** USAGE:
 ** Let "ptr" be a pointer to some structure which is at the head of
 ** a null-terminated list.  Then to sort the list call:
 **
 **     ptr = msort(ptr,&(ptr->next),cmpfnc);
 **
 ** In the above, "cmpfnc" is a pointer to a function which compares
 ** two instances of the structure and returns an integer, as in
 ** strcmp.  The second argument is a pointer to the pointer to the
 ** second element of the linked list.  This address is used to compute
 ** the offset to the "next" field within the structure.  The offset to
 ** the "next" field must be constant for all structures in the list.
 **
 ** The function returns a new pointer which is the head of the list
 ** after sorting.
 **
 ** ALGORITHM:
 ** Merge-sort.
 */

/*
 ** Return a pointer to the next structure in the linked list.
 */
#define NEXT(A) (*(char**)(((unsigned long)A)+offset))

/*
 ** Inputs:
 **   a:       A sorted, null-terminated linked list.  (May be null).
 **   b:       A sorted, null-terminated linked list.  (May be null).
 **   cmp:     A pointer to the comparison function.
 **   offset:  Offset in the structure to the "next" field.
 **
 ** Return Value:
 **   A pointer to the head of a sorted list containing the elements
 **   of both a and b.
 **
 ** Side effects:
 **   The "next" pointers for elements in the lists a and b are
 **   changed.
